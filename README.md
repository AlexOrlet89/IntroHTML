## The Golden Rule:

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan
Change header and add elements with all the required content (pronouns, locus, fun fact, etc)
add a paragraph element for your 'fun fact' section.
Focus on CSS styling, decide which effects you want and move any inline styling into css styles for "separation of interests"
